The Chakras of Light

The earth's atmosphere is a product of all the different material on the earth. As a result, 

heavier, more complex atoms will affect the light from the sun incident to the earth 

in more complex ways. 

The lights and colors given off by each organism and the structure that they are made out of should

reflect how well their bodies are able to metabolize light. 

Given I1 and I2, I can be expressed as multiple expressions of g where I=f(n)f(g), where f is the

frequency of light, g is the incidence of light, and f(n) is the amplitude of light (a polynomial),

g would then be a product of how fast an object was moving. 

To find the speed of light with reference to some system of moving objects:

1. o=(4/c-(v^2))[[((I1)^2)+((I2)^2)+2I1I2]cos(g)], where o is the opposite angle.

2. ((I1)^2)+((I2)^2)=-2I1I2cos(g)
    
   cos(g)=-(4/c-(v)^2)[((I1)^2)+((I2)^2)/2I1I2]
   
   g=invsec[-((I1I2)/((I1)^2)+((I2)^2))(c-(v^2)/2)].
   
   notice then that g is the speed of an object moving through time. It should be with respect to 
   
   the velocity of the sun. Each velocity defines the characteristics of each animak, and is
   
   indicated by the frequency of sound given or received by each chakra.
   
   For this reasons, we may intriduce an arbitrary variable x where I1=(x^5)+(On^4),
   
   where O represents polynomial n. Thus,
   
   3. ((x^5)+(On^4))^2 + (I2)^2 + 2((x^5)+(On^4))(I2)cos(g)=0.
   
   4. g is then invsec [-((((x^5)+(On^4))I2)/(((x^5)+(On^4))^2 +(I2)^2))((c-(v^2)/2)].
   
   ginvcos((c-(v^2)/2)=invsec((-((x^5)+(On^4))I2)/(((x^5)+(On^4))^2 +(I2)^2), thus
   
   5. ginvcos(c-(v^2)/2) = invsec((I2^2)-I2).
   
   6. I2=(x/2)(c-(v^2))-I1.
   
   7. As an animal breathes air, air distorts light by the velocity of blood traveling through its
   
   body, therefore, blood takes the form that appears red in the body, whereas tree fluids are not.
   
   That is, the reason that blood in large animals employs red iron while blood in smaller animals
   
   may be blue, clear, or purple, is that its purpose takes the form proportional to its velocity
   
   of an animal at a certain volume. Tree sap barely moves through the tree, and neither does the
   
   tree. Its blood is of something not expecting to be red shifted through time.
   
   8. Although wood does not become rubbery when accelerated in a small way, [E((f^k)/k!)(x^k)],
   
   animal flesh becomes rubbery upon being expected to accelerate itself (still being accelerated
   
   through time in the polynomial way). In presence of light from the sun, as light becomes more
   
   condensed and solid, solids dissolve, and light passes through them as the frequencies of light
   
   that are smaller than the space between its structures increase.
   
   9. Purple light oscillates very quickly, but travels in a small distance, red light takes much 
   
   longer to return to its source. Therefore, as the velocity of light decreases, the different 
   
   lights decelerate at different rates. 
   
   I1-I2(dv/dt) = I1-I2(E(n^2))^(1/2) means that light refracted at an angle implies 
   
   I1-I2((E(n^2))^(1/2))(dv/dt).
   
   The different colors become more distinct as the object speed increases 
   
   with respect to its light source.
